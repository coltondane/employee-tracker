## Usage
    This application is very easy to use directly in VS Code, or any other virtual coding environment as long as a terminal is accessible. The user will be able to operate the entire thing through the command-line in the terminal. The user should start by entering SOURCE schema.sql, followed by SOURCE seeds.sql, once they are logged into their local MySQL account. Then run node script.js and follow the CLI prompts.
